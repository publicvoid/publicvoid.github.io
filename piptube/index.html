      <p>You can drag the window by grabbing its top left corner (marked by <img src="img/drag.png"> symbol).</p>
      <div>Known issues:
        <ul>
          <li>Drag symbol may disappear when you place the mouse over it. Don't panic, it still works.</li>
          <li>Some videos (esp. music videos) won't play because their owners disabled playback on non-standard apps. Jerks!</li>
          <li>Some apps may overlay Piptube window when in fullscreen mode.</li>
        </ul>
        It has to be noted that any kind of bugs and glitches that you may encounter while using our product is by no means caused by low professional skills of our team, but only by irresistible forces of nature and Satan's nefarious deeds.
